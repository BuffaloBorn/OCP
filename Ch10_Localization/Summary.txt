There are four different kinds of locale codes in this output:
• Just one code, as in the last entry shown above: hu for Hungarian.
• Two codes separated by underscore, as in the first locale shown, ms_MY, where ms stands for Malaysia and MY stands for Malay.
• Three codes separated by underscores, as in no_NO_NY where no stands for Norway, NO for Norwegian, and NY for Nynorsk.
• Two or three initial codes separated by underscores and the final one by # or _#, as in th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai, which we’ll discuss now.
•  Here is how these locale names are encoded:language + "_" + country + "_" + (variant + "_#" | "#") + script + "-" + extensionsFor the locale
    code of th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai, The language code is th (Thai) and it is always written in lowercase.
• The country code is TH (Thailand) and it is always written in uppercase.
• The variant name is TH; here it repeats the country code, but it could be any string.
• The script name is an empty string here; if given, it will be a four-letter string with the first letter in uppercase and the rest in lowercase (e.g., Latn).
• The extension follows the # or _# character; it is u-nu-thai in this example.

packagequalifier.bundlename + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + (variant + "_#" | "#") + script + "-" + extensionsHere is the description of the elements in this fully qualified name: 
• packagequalifier: The name of the package (or the subpackages) in which the resource bundle is provided.
• bundlename: The name of the resource bundle that you’ll use in the program to refer and  load it.
• language: A two-letter abbreviation typically given in lowercase for the locale’s language  (in rare cases, it could be three letters as well).
• country: A two letter abbreviation typically given in uppercase for the locale’s country (in rare cases, it could be three letters as well).
• variant: An arbitrary list of variants (in lowercase or uppercase) to differentiate locales when you need more than one locale for a language and country combination.
